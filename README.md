# üß† 10 Days of Machine Learning - 10 Topics, 10 Mini Projects

This repository is my personal **revision sprint** to quickly refresh core machine learning by building something small and concrete for each topic.
Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks containing short notes.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

### Day 1 - Linear and Logistic Regression
 - **Project(s):** Auto Dataset Linear Regression, Titanic Logistic Regression, ISLP Boston Housing.
- **Purpose:** Revisiting regression vs classification basics, loss functions, basics of data visualisation and preprocessing.

### Day 2 - Decision Trees
- **Project(s):** Iris Classification, Pokemon Classification.
- **Purpose:** Understand flowchart splits, Gini impurity, overfitting.

### Day 3 - Random Forests
- **Project(s):** 
- **Purpose:** See how bagging, pasting and feature randomness improves stability over single trees.

### Day 4 - K-Nearest Neighbour

### Day 5 - Naive Bayes

### Day 6 - Support Vector Machine

### Day 7 - Clustering

### Day 8 - Dimensionality Reduction

### Day 9 - Neural Networks

### Day 10 - Gradient Boosting / XGBoosting

## üéØ Why this structure?
- **Breadth:** Cover the major ML families quickly.  
- **Hands-on:** Each topic has a runnable mini-project.  
- **Retention:** Writing code + notes for each day cements understanding.

# AI Learning Projects
