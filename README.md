# üß† 10 Days of Machine Learning - 10 Topics, 10 Mini Projects

This repository is my personal **revision sprint** to quickly refresh ideas on core machine learning by building something small and concrete for each topic.
Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks containing short notes.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

### Day 1 - Linear and Logistic Regression (03/09/2025)
 - **Project(s):** Auto Dataset Linear Regression, Titanic Logistic Regression, ISLP Boston Housing.
- **Purpose:** Revisiting regression vs classification basics, loss functions, basics of data visualisation and preprocessing.

### Day 2 - Decision Trees (04/09/2025)
- **Project(s):** Iris Classification, Pokemon Classification.
- **Purpose:** Understand flowchart splits, Gini impurity, overfitting.

### Day 3 - Random Forests (05/09/2025)
- **Project(s):** 
- **Purpose:** See how bagging, pasting and feature randomness improves stability over single trees.

### Day 4 - K-Nearest Neighbour (06/09/2025)
- **Project(s):** Mini Digits
- **Purpose:** Understand distance metrics, visualise data, understand how neighbours 'vote'

### Day 5 - Support Vector Machine (07/09/2025)
- **Project(s):**
- **Purpose:** Understand hyperplanes and how they're utilised in SVMs, visualise the margin and kernel trick

### Day 6 - Dimensionality Reduction (08/09/2025)
- **Project(s):**
- **Purpose:**

### Day 7 - Clustering (09/09/2025)
- **Project(s):**
- **Purpose:**

### Day 8 - ~~Dimensionality Reduction~~ (10/09/2025)
- **Project(s):**
- **Purpose:**

### Day 9 - Neural Networks (11/09/2025)
- **Project(s):**
- **Purpose:**

### Day 10 - Gradient Boosting / XGBoosting (12/09/2025)
- **Project(s):**
- **Purpose:**

## üéØ Why this structure?
- **Breadth:** Cover the major ML families quickly.  
- **Hands-on:** Each topic has a runnable mini-project.  
- **Retention:** Writing code + notes for each day cements understanding.
